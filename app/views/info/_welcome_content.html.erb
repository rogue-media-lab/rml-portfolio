    Welcome to the lab. I am Mason Roberts and this is my personal portfolio. This project is a bit different from others you may see. This is built to showcase both my talents as a designer and developer, as well as show off the power of Rails today. I use the latest technologies in the Rails ecosystem, including Hotwire, Turbo, Stimulus, and Tailwind CSS for the Frontend, Rails for the Backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.
    </p>

    Below you will find my featured projects. These projects hold a special place in my heart and I work on them in my free time. Each project is a small piece of larger projects I am working on. Each should feel like separate apps from the main portfolio. For example, the Zuke music player is the player I use for the Soundscape project. It is built as a demo. To give you an idea of the player functionality.

    With nearly seven years of self-taught experience, my toolkit has evolved from the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Node, MongoDB) to a sharp focus on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. I build on a Linux ThinkPad running Pop!_OS, leveraging modern AI workflows with Claude and Gemini, and designing in Figma and Krita. Whether it's complex AWS/Azure integrations or custom scripts, I apply the same philosophy to code as I do to cars: solve problems with precision, keep things running smoothly, and always leave room for creativity.

    Take a look around my workbench. Whether you're here to browse, learn, or partner on a project, I've designed this space to be as functional as it is personal. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
