    This is my digital workshop. A place where curiosity meets code. I'm Mason Roberts, the builder behind the lab. By day, I am an automotive technician with over 20 years of experience, training teams and keeping vehicles running with precision. By night, I switch gears to become a designer and developer, crafting the tools and projects I've always wanted.

    <p class="mb-4 pr-1">
    With nearly seven years of self-taught experience, my toolkit has evolved from the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Node, MongoDB) to a sharp focus on Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. I build on a Linux ThinkPad running Pop!_OS, leveraging modern AI workflows with Claude and Gemini, and designing in Figma and Krita. Whether it's complex AWS/Azure integrations or custom scripts, I apply the same philosophy to code as I do to cars: solve problems with precision, keep things running smoothly, and always leave room for creativity.

    This site is a multipurpose hub. For visitors and potential clients, it is a showcase of active projects, like my automotive maintenance app, the passion-project music player Zuke, and the long-dreamed Hermit Plus. It is also a growing library of development resources and the home base for my Substack and Patreon.
    </p>

    Take a look around my workbench. Whether you're here to browse, learn, or partner on a project, I've designed this space to be as functional as it is personal. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
